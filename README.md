# ExtraPlanetaryReinforcementLearning
Independent research project exploring reinforcement learning through the Q-learning algorithm. The environment in question is a gravity simulation including a pair of massive "planets", and a goal region, and defined boundaries. Among other questions, the research explore whether this learning method can learn a slingshot tactic.
